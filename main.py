You've never made one like this before.","Deadly to bats, lethal to humans.","It‚Äôs impressive, don‚Äôt you think? Vampire bats weigh almost nothing, but they can down a creature nearly ten times their size.","Like the original Spartans, we are the few against the many.","We have to push the boundaries, take the risks. Without that, there is no science. No medicine. No breakthroughs at all.","You know, the whole near death thing is very, very chic. I read it in Cosmo. Do they still make Cosmo? I don‚Äôt know."," As a result of my procedure, I have an overpowering urge to consume blood. Human blood.\nIn certain respects, I have succeeded far beyond anything I could have imagined. For the first time in my entire life, I feel good.\nYesterday, I could barely walk. Today, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm capable of.","I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm starting to get hungry. And you don‚Äôt want to see me when I‚Äôm hungry.","I've developed a form of echolocation. Bat radar, for the uninitiated.","‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù isn‚Äôt a term that I would use, detective. Unorthodox, maybe.
